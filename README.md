As a user
I want to see a list of my bookmarks
So I can keep track of websites I like

As a time-pressed user
So that I can save a website
I would like to add the site's address and title to bookmark manager

Connect to psql
Create the database using the psql command CREATE DATABASE bookmark_manager;
Connect to the database using the pqsl command \c bookmark_manager;
Run the query we have saved in the file 01_create_bookmarks_table.sql
